            Tired of forgetting the names of people who really deserve a spot on your personal blacklist? Enter The Hitlist—a darkly an app for keeping tabs on the people who’ve wronged you, annoyed you, or just chewed too loudly at lunch. 
            No actual harm encouraged—just the sweet satisfaction of organization and a little emotional catharsis. Log their names, the date of which you added them and their alive status. 
            Maybe even forgive… eventually. It’s petty. It’s pettily perfect. It’s The Hitlist. Because revenge is a dish best served… documented.
